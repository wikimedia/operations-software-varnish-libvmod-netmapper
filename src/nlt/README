In the interests of getting things done faster with mostly
  known-good code, this stuff is just a copy of the nlist/ntree
  code from gdnsd's plugin_geoip.  It would probably be more
  optimal to use a compressed tree for this vmod_netmapper
  code, but this uncompressed tree is pretty damned efficient,
  and it's really hard to implement a bug-free, efficient
  compressed tree for these network lookups in a short period
  of time, so I dropped that for now.

Minor modifications include stuff like:
  Removing debug and compiler-hint stuff that relied
    on gdnsd's infrastructure.
  Replacing the outer lookup function with one that
    doesn't use gdnsd-specific datastructures, and doesn't
    care about returning scope masks, etc.
  Adding headers as necessary.
  Removed list-merge stuff, pre-normalization stuff, map_name,
    etc that this code doesn't need.
  Removed internal error logging, replaced with retvals to
    indicate failures/warnings.

The functional algorithms and structures are unchanged.

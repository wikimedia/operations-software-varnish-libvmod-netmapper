1.9 - 2020-10-27
   Add '$ABI vrt' to src/vmod_netmapper.vcc to specify that we don't need
   an exact match between the Varnish used to compile vmod_netmapper and the
   version installed on a node.

1.8 - 2020-09-07
   Fix includes to build against Varnish 6

1.7 - 2018-04-23
   Fix implicit function declaration warning.

1.6 - 2018-02-23
   Fix NULL pointer deref crash during vcl_fini cleanup if a configured
     database file never existed from startup through fini.
   Added pthread_setname_np to set updater thread title to "netmap", otherwise
     it inherit's varnish's "cache-main", which is confusing.  This call isn't
     portable and we're using the Linux/glibc variant here without all the
     testing for other platforms' methods of setting it.

1.5 - 2017-08-23
   Varnish 5 compatibility update

1.4 - 2016-09-12
   Bugfix for varnish4 sending NULL ip_string

1.3 - 2016-02-02
   Use vrt_ctx pointers instead of a sess pointers in VMOD functions.
   Use VSLb instead of WSP for logging.
   Autotools-related changes because of the way vmods are built in Varnish 4.

1.2 - 2013-09-12
   Added vnm_validate cmdline tool.  Exit status indicates JSON parse-ability.
     Accepts IP addr as extra argument for manual results debugging.
   Added support for maskless IPs as implicit all-ones netmasks.
   Bugfix: memory issues in the strings allocator
   Backported more-robust network optimizer code from gdnsd
   Fixed "make distcheck"

1.1 - 2013-07-03
   Changed the API slightly from 1.0 - now supports multiple databases
     in a single VCL, which are differentiated by a text label.  VCL context
     is still used as well (that is, init/map calls in one VCL have no
     bearing on another).
   Removed all known fatal errors for things like missing/unloadable
     database files at startup/runtime.  In the case of a missing or malformed
     database file at startup, it will complain at startup and keep trying
     to load the DB on the reload intervals.  Until success, runtime queries
     will return no-match and also log an error.  In the case of a map request
     for a non-existent label (never specified in an init call), it returns
     no-match and logs an error.
   Fixed docs re: our variant on the build process.

1.0 - 2013-06-24
   First release

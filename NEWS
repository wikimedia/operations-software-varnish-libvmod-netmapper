1.1 - 2013-07-03
   Changed the API slightly from 1.0 - now supports multiple databases
     in a single VCL, which are differentiated by a text label.  VCL context
     is still used as well (that is, init/map calls in one VCL have no
     bearing on another).
   Removed all known fatal errors for things like missing/unloadable
     database files at startup/runtime.  In the case of a missing or malformed
     database file at startup, it will complain at startup and keep trying
     to load the DB on the reload intervals.  Until success, runtime queries
     will return no-match and also log an error.  In the case of a map request
     for a non-existent label (never specified in an init call), it returns
     no-match and logs an error.
   Fixed docs re: our variant on the build process.
